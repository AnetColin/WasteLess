### Project Description
WasteLess Smart Kitchen is a dynamic web app that helps users track food items in their kitchen by adding name, quantity, and expiry dates. It displays real‑time status (Fresh / At Risk / Expired), generates simple prediction stats, and highlights items nearing expiry in a colorful, animated UI. This tool helps reduce food waste and keeps users informed about their pantry at a glance. 

### The Problem statement
Despite growing awareness of sustainability, household food waste remains a major problem. Globally, households are responsible for a large share of food waste — with more than one billion meals discarded every day, contributing to about 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and wasting valuable resources like land, water, and energy.
At the consumer level, people often forget what food they have, misinterpret expiry dates, and lack simple tools to track and manage their pantry items. As a result, edible food is thrown away unnecessarily, increasing both everyday waste and environmental impact.
WasteLess Smart Kitchen addresses this challenge by giving users a dynamic way to track the food they already have, monitor expiry dates, and reduce preventable waste through organized pantry management and timely reminders.

### The Solution
WasteLess Smart Kitchen provides a simple yet powerful digital pantry management tool that helps users avoid food waste and stay organized:
-Users can add food items with name, quantity, and expiry date so nothing gets forgotten.
-The app calculates and displays the status of items dynamically (Fresh / At Risk / Expired) based on real dates.
-It gives users predictive insights about how many items are fresh or near expiry and highlights those that need attention.
-Through its vibrant, animated UI and status indicators, users get intuitive reminders of what needs to be used soon — a form of practical expiry alerting similar to smart pantry trackers that help households reduce food waste by monitoring expiration dates and issuing alerts.
This solution turns manual tracking (notes or memory) into a smart, visual, and real‑time digital experience that encourages mindful use of food and helps reduce everyday household waste.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (core web languages used to build dynamic interfaces and interactivity)
- Frameworks used: No major frontend framework (built with vanilla JavaScript + DOM manipulation)
- Libraries used: None (custom JavaScript logic for UI updates and expiry calculations)
- Tools used:
     VS Code — Code editor for development
     Git & GitHub — Version control for project collaboration
     Firebase Hosting — Web app deployment platform
-For Backend / Database:
   Firebase (hosting) — Used to serve the web app online (no persistent backend database yet)
-For UI & Animations:
  CSS gradients and transitions for vibrant background effects
  JavaScript DOM animations and state‑based UI updates
-For Project Management/Deployment:
   GitHub for source control
  Firebase Console for deployment settings

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
